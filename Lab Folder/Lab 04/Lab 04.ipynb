    "From Farm to Table: The Grocery Store Management System\n",
    "\n",
    "In the heart of the vibrant town of Freshville was a quaint little grocery store named \"Farmers' Harvest.\" Owned by a passionate entrepreneur named Emily, Farmers' Harvest was renowned for its locally sourced produce, friendly atmosphere, and commitment to community sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emily had always dreamed of owning a grocery store that offered the community fresh, local, and organic produce. Her vision was to create a place where people could shop for quality groceries and connect with local farmers and artisans. She opened Farmers' Harvest with unwavering determination and a love for sustainable living.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Farmers' Harvest gained popularity, it faced a significant challenge â€“ efficiently managing sales. Emily realized she needed a robust Grocery Store Management System (GSMS) to maintain the store's reputation for quality and freshness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emily hired you as a team lead for a talented set of developers: Alex, Lisa, and Carlos. Together, you will create an advanced GSMS to revolutionise Farmers' Harvest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software Emily is looking for is straightforward and has to store the orders in a file the store gets from its customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data analyst specialist, gather insights from their customers' orders received for Farmers' Harvest in Freshville over time and display them to Emily as she uses your Application."
